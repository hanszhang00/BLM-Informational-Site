# Contributing

We use the [**Github issue page**](https://github.com/hanszhang00/blm-resources/issues) to keep track of stuff we want to fix and improve on. We also use the page as a platform for anyone to ask any design or clarifying questions!

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via the
Github issue page [**here**](https://github.com/hanszhang00/blm-resources/issues). If you have any questions regarding project features, or ideas for potential new features, please also use the issue page and label your ideas with **appropriate tags**. The community members will be able to discuss it directly in your issue post.

If you want to contribute content-wise, whether it is new videos, articles, or organizations, please use to our [**backend api**](https://github.com/hanszhang00/blm-resources-api) to contribute!

If you have further questions or concerns, feel free to send me an email [**here**](mailto:hanszhang2000@gmail.com)

Once you join our project and make your first contribution, we will list you as one of our [**contributors**](https://github.com/hanszhang00/blm-resources/graphs/contributors) and add your profile in our [**README**](/README.md). I truly believe that working on an open-source project will make you a better programmer and communicator, and it will also give you something meaningful to talk about when you talk to a recruitor (if you are going to industry in the future)!

**Please note we have a code of conduct**, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.
